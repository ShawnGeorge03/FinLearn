## Folder Structure

This Folder Structure is based on a blog from [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/organizing-express-js-project-structure-better-productivity/).

The main entry point of the server is the [`server.ts`](https://github.com/CSCC012023/final-project-s23-agile-avengers/blob/main/server/src/server.ts) which is inside the [`src`](https://github.com/CSCC012023/final-project-s23-agile-avengers/blob/main/server/src) folder and can be run by using this command `npm run dev`. All routes and middleware will be included in this folder.
