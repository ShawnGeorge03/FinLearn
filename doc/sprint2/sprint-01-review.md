- Where: Zoom

## Participants

## Process - Reflection

- Created a board on [RetroTool](https://retrotool.io/nWOr7XFwbqkaJ64CxS607).
- Everyone filled out Liked, Learnt, and Lacked columns.
- Discussed each entry with the team and reflected on it.

### Decisions that turned out well

- Team Work, Ethic, and Consistency: The way the project is organized and tasks are distributed among team members made it extremely easy to develop the product.
- Assistance from teammate: Team members who were new to a technology or concept asked for help from other team members and they did not hesitate to help out.
- Estimation: Properly defined the amount of work each task took and completed it within the deadline.
- Definition: All tasks were outlined clearly and acceptance criteria was well defined.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Last minute changes: A bunch of commits happened at the last moment which
  indicates poor estimation of individual members' work.
- Lack of documentation depth for testing: Need more robust postman testing
  for created endpoints.
- UI Responsiveness: Need to improve on the overall UI experience and
  responsiveness.

### Planned changes

- Find a convention for WebDev along with Error Messages in Backend
- Improve SubDocument Querying
